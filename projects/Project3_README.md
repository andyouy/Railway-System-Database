# Challenges

With projects from other classes and finals I didn't get much time to work on this project. But since it was
my first time writing in Python, I didn't really understand how to get the sql code to work and didn't know 
what type of error I was running into. I found that the parameters needed certain variables to be set. The variables
that I needed were found here: https://pymysql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/connections.html.
